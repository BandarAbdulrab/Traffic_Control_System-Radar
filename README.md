# Traffic_Control_System-Radar
An Arduino-based Traffic Control System (Radar), built to detect vehicle density on four roads. It dynamically adjusts traffic lights based on vehicle density, giving priority to the road with the least congestion. The code is written in Arduino (C++) and designed to work with an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, and LED traffic lights.
